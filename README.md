clevis-builder is a quick Dockerfile I threw together to build a new clevis deb package based on clevis v12 which supports initramfs. In this journey I ran into some issues and have provided a workaround here. I hope to have these patches accepted upstream so I do not have to maintain this. For now I will continue to maintain this so that I can get clevis working for Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04.

I hope to outline these issues more specifically below when I find time as well.
